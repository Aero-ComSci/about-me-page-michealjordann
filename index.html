  <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>Hello, My name is Tanush Pusuluri, and my personal career goals are to work at a company as prestigious as at least the ones my parents worked at, and get a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. Mostly anything in the computer science field that pays decently would be fine with me for my job. My main goal is to make myself and my parents happy, and maintaining a good and happy life in general. This is mostly my choice for my career because I have always had an interest for coding. My parents also support this idea and can help me on my journey for this. My dream colleges would be UC Berkeley, MIT, and Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo. </p>
        <h3>Strengths, Personal Qualities, and Important Characteristics</h3>
        <p>Some Characteristics I have relating to this career are that I am a team player, I'm supportive, and I'm Patient. I am a team player because I like collaborating with people and usually don't do anything without another group member's permission, A supportive person because I try to be there and kind for others in my group, and patient because I understand that some things in a project take time and that some people don't have the same way of thinking as me or the same ideas. I honestly do not have a lot of major accomplishments from high school, since I am just a freshman in the second semester, but some notable things I have done are get straight A's in the first quarter of the year, and maintain decent grades throughout the year so far.</p>
        <h3>My Abilities and Work Skills</h3>
        <p>My abilities and work skills came from when I did not make the Emerald High Basketball team after trying out, because of my tardiness on the second day of tryouts.I learned something very important from this,which is that I need to learn how to plan better, and execute that plan just as well. This was definitely one of the hardest ways I could have learned this and because of this my planning and more is better, as well as my punctuality when it comes to things that are important to me or just important in general.
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>In conclusion, my career goals are to get a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science, and to make my parents happy. Some characteristics about me are that I am a team player, I'm supportive, and patient. I learned how to plan and execute accordingly, and made punctuality a habit from past mistakes instead of dwelling on them. Thank you for your time, and check out the rest of my portfolio. Thank you! </p>
